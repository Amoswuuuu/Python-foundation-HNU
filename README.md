# Python-foundation-HNU
This is a Python-based project that includes basic Python entry and an introduction to Python crawlers.This project was born in the Spring Festival of 2018. It was a sharing for the students after I started school.

The content of PPT is the main line of the whole project. It contains six parts: Python, Python application prospects, why to learn Python, how to learn Python, Python simple practice, and first-time Python crawler.
